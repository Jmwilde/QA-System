## Notes ##
In order to use this QA system, you need the data to be in a 
directory called "hw7_dataset" that is on the same level as the QA.py
file. The program will look in that directory to in order to process
the data and give answers accordingly.

Also, the main program is in QA.py. The other Python files have specific
helper functions that the QA system uses.
